functions for preparation, e.g. loading data
instantiate different pre-trained models
create different pre-trained weights
define hyperparameters
    different dataset size
    different number of epochs
    batch size
    refer to a3 for reference
    learning rate? it seems like thre is no point in comparing different learning rate because you always choose a learning rate from the validation curves

fix different parts of the models and fine-tune
